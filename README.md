Our application pulls in job listings via a REST API integration from Jooble into the Opportunity object in Salesforce. We decided to re-label the standard Opportunity object as "Job Application", as it already comes ready with the necessary infrastructure and  objects relationships (Company (Account), Contact, Tasks, Event, EmailMessage etc).
You can find more details in the project [data dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QRfnGbLNfgtEUAKMYGZPw1dyLdoIZBDWgGTYrKgd_ag/edit?usp=sharing). 

## Main Features of the Job Application App:
- Integration with the [Jooble](www.jooble.org) job web site
- Functionality to track applications
- Automatic task creation based on job application stage
- Automatic interview reminders and stale application closing functionality
- Email automation
